### Maintainer steps to add a new language

1. To be compatible with Home Assistant, language tags have to follow [BCP 47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp47). A list of most language tags can be found here: [IANA subtag registry](http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry). Examples: `fr`, `fr-CA`, `zh-Hans`.
2. Create a new file `{language_code}.json` with your language code in the [translation folder](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom/tree/main/src/translations). Examples: `fr.json`.
3. Import your file into the [`localize.ts file`](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom/blob/main/src/localize.ts) and add your language in the `languages` record.
4. Don't forget to test locally with the development server by choosing the language with the Home Assistant UI in your profile.
