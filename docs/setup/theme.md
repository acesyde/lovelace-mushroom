### Customization

Mushroom works without theme but you can add a theme for better experience by installing the [Mushroom Themes](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom-themes). If you want more information about themes, check out the official [Home Assistant documentation about themes](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/frontend/#defining-themes).
