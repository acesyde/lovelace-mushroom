## What is mushroom ?

Mushroom is a collection of cards for [Home Assistant][home-assistant] Lovelace UI.

Mushroom mission is to propose easy to use components to build your [Home Assistant][home-assistant] dashboard.

### Features

-   🛠 Editor for **all cards** and and **all options** (no need to edit `yaml`)

-   🖌 Color picker
-   🚀 0 dependencies : no need to install another card.
-   🌈 Based on Material UI colors
-   🌓 Light and dark theme support
